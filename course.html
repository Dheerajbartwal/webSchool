                <p>The place where children as the leaders of tomorrow study and where the future of nation is shaped is called school. Since, education is essential weapon for tomorrow, so the good schools of today are important for the best future of a
                    nation. I am proud of myself that I am studying in one of the best school of my town. And I consider myself to be best future of not only of my family but my country..</p>

                <p>
                    The full form of Inter is Intermediate and its Hindi meaning is Higher Secondary. Those who conduct the 12th exam are called intermediate exams and those who qualify the 12th exam are called inter paas. Now you know what is called inter, then instead
                    of saying 12th pass, you can also say inter paas..</p>

                <p>When I arrived at the school at 11 a.m. I saw that all the arrangements had been made by the host students. The school hall was beautifully decorated with charts, posters, flowers and placards. The main table on which the principal and
                    the chairman of the school were to be seated, was beautifully decorated with flowerpots. There were many chairs for the outgoing students, staff and the students of class XI. he party began at 12 p.m. For about one hour, we ate to
                    our heart’s content, chatted and laughed without restrictions. The party came to an end at 3 p.m.

                <h3>Harela Parav</h3>
                <p>Earth faces a triple planetary emergency: the climate is heating up too quickly for people and nature to adapt; habitat loss and other pressures mean an estimated 1 million species are threatened with extinction; pollution continues to
                    poison our air, land and water. The way out of this dilemma is to transform our economies and societies to make them inclusive, fair and more connected with nature. We must shift from harming the planet to healing it. The good news
                    is the solutions and the technology exist and are increasingly affordable. is the campaign for World Environment Day 2022. It calls for collective, transformative action on a global scale to celebrate, protect and restore our planet.</p>
