                <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs For 2023</h2>
                <p>The name of my school is Saraswati vidya mandir jakhanidhar tehri Garwal. It’s not very far from my house. It is situated in tehri garhwal, near the jakhanidhar. I have been reading there since my childhood. Nearly eight hundred students
                    read here. The number of teachers at present is 10. The school building is quite commodious with ten rooms in two floors. The number of students in each class is between forty to fifty. The school has a newly built multipurpose auditorium
                    with a seating capacity of 500. The auditorium is well-equipped for activities like school events for students and parents, drama, theatre and indoor sports such as Badminton. The school has a good system of sanitation. Special arrangements
                    are retained for drinking water. The students have other facilities also. There is a good library, a common room and an open playground in the school. Sports and games are regularly held here.</p>
                <p>School is the place where we learn to read and write. It is the most crucial place for a student, and it helps us to learn new things. The teachers are always helpful and teach us important things in life. We must always be regular to
                    school as missing classes can lead to problems during exams. Schools teach us how to be consistent, punctual, and obedient. It also makes us better human beings so that we can treat our elders with respect. Most of what we learn is
                    a result of the learning imparted by our teachers.</p>
                <p>The foundations of our learning are laid by our schools. School is the place that instills in us a sense of responsibility and hardworking spirit. We become better versions of ourselves through the rigorous tests that we are put through
                    at schools. Each exam, each activity, and each lesson is aimed towards making us learn and grow. Right from the beginning, we are taught to be morally responsible for all our actions. The various subjects introduce us to the world’s
                    diversity and allow us to explore our surroundings with a unique perspective. We never know what problems await us when we grow up; schools are the training grounds that prepare us to face the unknown. We can overcome any hardship
                    with the right motivation, and schools do that for us. We are not only taught to be responsible citizens but also hardworking individuals who strive hard to face the challenges that life throws at us.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>All great men have been taught to read and write at their schools. It is our school that endows us with the right values at an early age. We teach a set of strong moral values that serve us later in our lives. School life is the period
                    that makes up most of your childhood memories. We learn to laugh, cry, share, and support by co-habiting with our classmates. Schools are the framework that builds our moral characters and serves as a pathway that we must follow to
                    achieve our dreams. The initial years pass like a breeze and are the best years of our school life but, the advanced grades teach us that life is not always easy. We fail in tests, we stay awake at nights to finish assignments, we
                    get scolded by teachers, but most importantly, we learn how to cope up with the hardships that life throws at us. Schools have a tremendous responsibility in shaping the minds of millions of young minds that are as soft as wet mud.
                    The teachers are excellent potters who mold us so that the resultant figure is ready to bear the weight of life without cracking. Even if the later stages of school life feel like a burden, we must remember that our school’s happiest
                    times have been spent</p>
